Hi 👋🏼, I’m Georg, a London-based growth hacker with a hands-on approach to turning ideas into thriving businesses. I’ve helped startups and SMEs transform their nurtured concepts into success stories through practical execution. What sets me apart is simple: I don’t just talk the talk—I walk the walk. I even offer my services commission-based, with no upfront cost, effectively paying for myself—the way performance marketing is supposed to be.
