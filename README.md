Hi, I’m Georg, a London based growth hacker with a hands on approach to turning ideas into thriving businesses. I’ve helped start ups and small to medium sized enterprises turn carefully developed concepts into real success through practical execution. What sets me apart is simple: I do not just talk the talk, I walk the walk. I primarily offer my services on a commission basis, effectively covering my own cost, which is how growth marketing is meant to work.
